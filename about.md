I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>.

I'm passionate about Security and I love playing CTFs with my team
<a target="_blank" href="https://l4ser.github.io">*fuffateam*</a>.

I was part of the Codejitsu team, led by Prof. Dawn Song, that partecipated at
the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge">Cyber Grand
Challenge (CGC)</a>, where we got the 3rd place at the Qualification Event and
we scored 5th at the Final Event. From September 2014 to March 2015 I was a Jr.
Specialist at UC Berkeley, where I developed the project of my M.Sc thesis.
Later I worked on Binkungfu, a python project written from scratch for the CGC,
to analyze and instrument binaries by directly working at the assembly level.

I got my M.Sc degree in Computer Science on February 2017, at Università degli
Studi di Milano, Italy, with a final grade of 110/110 cum laude. My thesis was
about *Blazar*, a system to automatically disassemble, analyze and instrument
CGC binaries by using the LLVM Intermediate Representation.

I got my B.Sc degree in Computer Science on October 2013, at Università degli
Studi di Milano, Italy, with a final grade of 110/110 cum Laude. My B.Sc thesis
is titled "Studio e implementazione di un integrity-checker hardware-assisted"
and it can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/static/files/bsc_thesis.pdf).
